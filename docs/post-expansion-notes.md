# Post Expansion Notes

This document captures the working rules for feed post-body expansion and the startup-specific failure modes that have regressed repeatedly.

## Working Model

Post expansion is intentionally narrow:

1. Scan the current visible root for likely story-body expanders.
2. Prioritize buttons inside `story_message`, `story_body`, and story-preview containers.
3. Press only visible `See more`-style controls that still look like inline post truncation.
4. Avoid menus, media controls, and unrelated feed buttons.
5. Keep Home expansion independent from the disabled React-owned feed cleanup.
6. On Home, require an exact button inside a story body, reject links/navigation,
   and ignore off-screen virtualized controls.

## First-Post Startup Behavior

- The first visible feed post is special because Facebook often hydrates it in stages.
- A valid `See more` button may already be in the DOM before Facebook attaches the live click handler.
- Startup therefore waits for saved settings and DOM readiness, then lets the
  scoped feed observer react to later story-body hydration.
- A native click that does nothing before Facebook wires the control must not
  permanently suppress a replacement or subsequently mutated button.

## Candidate Rules

- Prioritize buttons inside:
  - `[data-ad-rendering-role="story_message"]`
  - `[data-ad-rendering-role="story_body"]`
  - `[data-ad-comet-preview="message"]`
- Treat preview-message containers like story-message containers for first-feed posts.
- Reject controls inside obvious menu/toolbar surfaces.
- Require post-context signals before clicking anything generic.

## Retry Rules

- Post-expander retries must be bounded.
- Retry cooldowns must be short enough to catch startup hydration, but not so aggressive that the same control is spam-clicked continuously.
- Do not revert to a permanent one-shot blacklist for post expanders; that was the direct cause of the first-post regression.

## Things To Avoid

- Do not broaden feed-wide click heuristics just to fix the first visible post.
- Do not treat all top-of-feed failures as selector misses.
- Do not permanently mark a `See more` button as handled unless the retry window has been exhausted.
- Do not add broad random-click recovery behavior.

## Minimum Regression Pass

After touching post expansion, verify all of the following:

1. Reload the main feed with the first post truncated.
2. Confirm the first visible post expands during startup, before scrolling away.
3. Confirm the first post does not keep the literal `See more` text inline in the body.
4. Confirm later feed posts still expand normally.
5. Confirm no unrelated menu, dialog, or media surface opens.
6. Confirm already-expanded posts are not repeatedly spam-clicked.
7. Scroll until a newly hydrated truncated post appears and confirm the bounded
   post-scroll pass expands it without changing the page position.
